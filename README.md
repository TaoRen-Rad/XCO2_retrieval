# Fast XCO2 Retrieval Project

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources and code for the fast retrieval of XCO2 (Carbon Dioxide Column Average Dry Air Mole Fraction) over East Asia, based on the OCO-2 spectral measurements. It aligns with the research presented in the paper: "Fast retrieval of XCO2 over East Asia based on the OCO-2 spectral measurements" (Xie et al., 2023).

## Contents

### Folders

1. **MLP-XCO2 Model Parameters**: This folder contains the parameters for the MLP-XCO2 model.
2. **MLP-P Model Parameters**: Here, you can find the parameters for the MLP-P model along with the corresponding normalization parameters.

### Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Spectral Preprocessing Interpolation**: This notebook covers the preprocessing and interpolation of spectral data.
2. **Non-Spectral Data Preprocessing**: This notebook focuses on the preprocessing of non-spectral data.
3. **MLP-XCO2 Training Example**: This notebook includes code for training the MLP-XCO2 model and testing its performance on data from 2017-2020.
