
# Fast XCO2 Retrieval Project

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources and code for the fast retrieval of XCO2 (Carbon Dioxide Column Average Dry Air Mole Fraction) over East Asia, based on the OCO-2 spectral measurements. It aligns with the research presented in the paper: "Fast retrieval of XCO2 over East Asia based on the OCO-2 spectral measurements" (Xie et al., 2023).
